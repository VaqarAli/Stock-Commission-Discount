# Stock-Commission-Discount

Stock broking firm has decided to provide special discounts to customer who brings a considerable amount of business to them. They cannot give this special offer to their every single customer so they have divided their customer base into 2 groups viz. revenue grid 1 and revenue grid 2. Based on this segregation they can identify whom to provide discount.

We'll be using feature engineering, data wrangling, logistic regression for prediction and KS matrix to converted the predicted probabilites to hard classes.
